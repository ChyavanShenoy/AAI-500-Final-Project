# Comparision of several models for Air Quality Index Prediction

This project is a part of the AAI-500 course in the Applied Artificial Intelligence Program at the University of San Diego (USD).

- Project Status: Completed

## Installation

- Installation of should be pretty straight forward. You may choose to follow the following instructions to avoid polluting your bas python environment.

* You may be required to install the `python3-venv` package if you do not have it already.

1. `git clone https://github.com/ChyavanShenoy/AAI-500-Final-Project.git`
2. `python3 -m venv venv`  
   If you have `Linux/Unix` system follow the following:
3. `source .venv/bin/activate`
   If you have a Windows system:
4. `.\venv\Scripts\activate`
5. `pip3 install ipykernel`

## Using the notebook

You may now open the notebook `Team 1.ipynb` using your editor of choice such as `vscode` or `pycharm` or even `jupyter notebook`.  
When prompted to use the kernel, make sure to choose the virtual environment you just created.

## Project Intro

This project aims to compare a machine learning models and predict the AQI index and classify the category.  
We would be training the following models:

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- XGBoost
- Multi layer perceptron

We would be doing the folloing tasks:

- Classify the catgory of the AQI value
- Predict the index

## project Description

This is an exploratory project, which aims to give us a hands on approach of machine learning concepts and different models.  
We decided to go with the [AQI Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adityaramachandran27/world-air-quality-index-by-city-and-coordinates/data) from kaggle.  
There are 4 columns of interest for training this model, with 2 target columns, one for classification, and the other for regression.
